# ARUNDA TRADER — CHECKPOINT LEDGER

## PURPOSE
Compact historical truth. Detailed forensic reports remain historical artifacts and are not repeated in every Builder session.

## FINAL PROJECT LIFECYCLE — MANDATORY
1. Complete and close the exchange-agnostic ArundaTrader project/core.
2. Bind an exchange only after explicit project-completion closure.
3. Perform final real-market exchange integration and controlled testing.
4. Enable real trading only after final acceptance and explicit Management authorization.

## CP41 — DECISION → TRADE INTENT BOUNDARY
CP41 = CLOSED / VERIFIED / PASS
Implementation:
- `decision_trade_intent_boundary_v0_1.py`
- `test_cp41_decision_trade_intent_boundary_v0_1.py`
Evidence:
- 12 focused tests passed.
- Compile/static verification passed.
- Scope/diff verification passed.
- No order, execution, API write, or production DB write occurred.

## CP43 — PRE-EXECUTION READY PACKAGE
CP43 = CLOSED / VERIFIED / PASS
Implementation:
- `pre_execution_readiness_v0_1.py`
- `execution_ready_package_v0_1.py`
- `test_cp43_pre_execution_readiness_v0_1.py`
- `test_cp43_execution_ready_package_v0_1.py`
Evidence:
- 77/77 focused tests passed.
- Compile verification passed.
- git diff --check passed.
- Worktree clean at closure.
- EXECUTION AUTHORIZATION = FALSE.
- No runtime order, execution, API write, or production DB mutation occurred.

## CP44 — REAL-MARKET CONTROLLED TEST
CP44 = CURRENT FRONTIER
CP44 = MANAGEMENT-AUTHORIZED / EXECUTED / OBSERVED / NOT VERIFIED / NOT CLOSED

### Runtime observation
A controlled real-market runtime was executed from the established downstream eligibility boundary.
**Observed: 6 assets reached ELIGIBLE.**

This is runtime evidence only. It does not independently close or verify CP44.

### Required chain
REAL MARKET → VALIDATED OBSERVATIONS → DECISION → TRADE INTENT → PRE-EXECUTION / CONSTRAINT READINESS → CONTROLLED TEST RESULT

### Required evidence
REAL_MARKET_DATA
VALIDATED_OBSERVATIONS
REAL_CAPITAL_BOUNDARY
VALID_ENTRY
VALID_STOP
VALID_QUANTITY
VALID_EXPOSURE
DECISION_CONSISTENCY
TRADE_INTENT_CONSISTENCY
CONSTRAINT_READINESS
PROVENANCE
FAIL_CLOSED
DYNAMIC_ASSET
NO_TEST_DATA
NO_FIXED_15
NO_ORDER
NO_AUTHORIZATION
NO_EXECUTION
NO_API_WRITE
NO_DB_WRITE

### Forward rule
The established ELIGIBLE path is the operational boundary for forward work. Do not rebuild, redesign, or re-audit upstream layers merely to reproduce the observed six-asset ELIGIBLE state.

## TOOBIT DIAGNOSTIC HISTORY
CP37-M: real read-only account call returned HTTP 400 / API -1022 INVALID_SIGNATURE.
CP37-MA: -1022 confirmed; root cause not proven.
CP37-MB: local signing diagnostic PASS: payload match, parameter order match, HMAC match.
CP37-MC: official Toobit signing contract reviewed; root cause remained NOT_PROVEN.

The Toobit -1022 INVALID_SIGNATURE remains an independent Account/Real-Capital path blocker. Do not reopen or repeat private diagnostics without explicit authorization.

## GOVERNANCE — MANDATORY
Closed/Verified checkpoints are historical state. They become current only if Management explicitly identifies a regression.

### ROADMAP IS THE ONLY PATH
All work must map to MANAGEMENT_ROADMAP.md and the active checkpoint. No parallel project truth is permitted.

### BRANCH / FILE RULE
No project branch may be created for personal workflow, experimentation, convenience, or unapproved parallel work. New files require defined responsibility, active-checkpoint necessity, and authorized scope. Temporary, generated, backup, quarantine, forensic, review, and unrelated artifacts are not automatically project truth.

### CHECKPOINT CLOSURE GATE
At the end of EVERY checkpoint, synchronize:
1. PROJECT_STATE.md
2. CURRENT_FRONTIER.md
3. CHECKPOINTS.md
4. MANAGEMENT_ROADMAP.md

The synchronization must record BUILT, VERIFIED, CLOSED/BLOCKED/NOT VERIFIED, evidence, blocker, CURRENT FRONTIER, NEXT ACTION, and authorized branch/file scope.
