# ARUNDA TRADER — MANAGEMENT ROADMAP

## AUTHORITY
This document is the authoritative management route for project advancement. The roadmap is the only path.

## FINAL OBJECTIVE
Complete and verify ArundaTrader as a **profit-seeking, intelligent, exchange-agnostic real-market decision system** before binding any exchange.

## CORE ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE
The system must not be designed around Toobit, Binance, or any other exchange. Exchange adapters are downstream consumers of an already-complete exchange-agnostic Order Intent / Boundary contract.

Until `EXCHANGE-AGNOSTIC BOUNDARY`, the core must remain provider-neutral.

## PROFIT-SEEKING OBJECTIVE
The primary optimization objective is **maximum validated profit opportunity capture**, not minimum risk and not maximum risk.

Risk management exists to make allocation intelligent and evidence-based, not to impose an arbitrary universal profit ceiling.

The system must distinguish:
- Opportunity / profit assessment — how attractive the opportunity is.
- Risk / invalidation — where the thesis is invalid and what constraints apply.
- Capital allocation — how much capital the validated opportunity deserves.
- Position sizing — how allocation becomes quantity using Entry and Stop/Invalidation.
- Trade Gate — whether the complete decision is internally valid and executable in principle.

Capital amount is a scale/input boundary, not the intelligence of the system. The same opportunity logic must work across different valid capital amounts.

Allocation is an intelligent output. It is not architecturally fixed to 20%, 50%, 0.5%, or any other universal ceiling. Depending on validated opportunity and constraints, allocation may be 0% through 100%.

100% allocation is neither inherently required nor forbidden; it is simply one possible output of the intelligence when validated by the complete opportunity, invalidation, liquidity, exposure, and portfolio state.

## MANDATORY LIFECYCLE

```

Rules:
- No exchange-specific architecture becomes Core.
- Exchange adapters remain replaceable environment boundaries.
- Dynamic runtime cardinality is preserved: `ELIGIBLE[N] → RISK[N] → TRADE_GATE[N]`.
- `15` is legacy test-universe history, not a production cardinality contract.
- Closed/verified checkpoints remain historical truth unless Management proves regression.
- No runtime, DB write, API write, or execution is implied merely by roadmap position.

Current position:
- CP41 = CLOSED / VERIFIED / PASS
- CP43 = CLOSED / VERIFIED / PASS
- CP44 = CURRENT FRONTIER / MANAGEMENT-AUTHORIZED / IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED / REAL-MARKET CONTROLLED TEST EXECUTED / BLOCKED / NOT VERIFIED / NOT CLOSED

### PHASE B — EXCHANGE BINDING
May begin only after Phase A completion is explicitly closed and recorded in all four governance documents.

### PHASE C — FINAL REAL-MARKET EXCHANGE INTEGRATION / CONTROLLED TEST
After Phase B authorization, integrate the selected exchange through the exchange adapter boundary and perform final controlled testing. No real order is implied.

### PHASE D — REAL TRADING
Requires Phase A/B/C closure, satisfied execution/risk/constraint gates, and explicit Management authorization.

## CP44 MANAGEMENT STATE
The authorized CP44 implementation has been verified on `sync/local-project-20260917` at `b9c029ed7ef1da9a7d7fb53617769a35b8280246`.

Verified implementation evidence:
- five CP44 Smart Risk/Entry surfaces compile successfully with Python 3.13.15;
- existing Smart Risk test exits `0`;
- corrected Dynamic Smart Risk boundary test exits `0` with `CP44_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY_PASS`;
- explicit `BTC/USDT` LONG entry/invalidation geometry is accepted;
- entry `100000.0`, invalidation `99000.0`, stop distance `1000.0`;
- Smart Risk result `APPROVED`;
- dynamic snapshot cardinality `1 → 1`;
- no order, execution, API write, or production DB write occurred.

## CP44 REAL-MARKET CONTROLLED RUNTIME RESULT
The single authorized CP44 real-market controlled runtime was executed from the established downstream ELIGIBLE boundary.

Observed blocker:
`INSUFFICIENT_CONTIGUOUS_CONTEXT:MHA/USDT:7`

Required minimum context:
`MIN_CONTEXT = 21`

The runtime failed closed because the required real contiguous context was unavailable. Therefore the production-compatible Entry + Invalidation/Stop → Smart Risk → Trade Gate → Trade Ready chain was not proven and CP44 remains BLOCKED / NOT VERIFIED / NOT CLOSED.

This is the authoritative CP44 runtime result. No second runtime is authorized until the blocker is resolved and Management explicitly authorizes readiness.

## CP44 FORWARD CHAIN
```text
ELIGIBLE[N]

PRE-EXECUTION
```

Do not rebuild or redesign Opportunity / Signal / Score / Fusion / Decision merely to reproduce the runtime observation.

## CP44 CURRENT BLOCKER
`INSUFFICIENT_CONTIGUOUS_CONTEXT:MHA/USDT:7` with `MIN_CONTEXT = 21`.

The required condition is naturally accumulated, real, contiguous post-launch market context for MHA/USDT. No synthetic data, interpolation, fill, padding, fabricated fallback, or backfill is permitted.

After blocker resolution, the next authorized runtime must prove production-compatible Entry + Invalidation/Stop, opportunity-driven allocation, quantity/exposure, Trade Gate, Trade Ready, Order Intent, and pre-execution readiness with dynamic `N`.

The legacy `market_entry_stop_adapter.py` fixed-15 snapshot path must not become the production route.

## SAFETY BOUNDARY
- EXECUTION AUTHORIZATION = FALSE
- ORDER WRITE = FORBIDDEN
- DATABASE WRITE = FORBIDDEN
- WITHDRAW = FORBIDDEN
- Exchange writes = FORBIDDEN
- Signature work = FORBIDDEN
- No test capital.
- `arunda_pipeline.py` remains protected.

## CHECKPOINT ADVANCEMENT GATE
At the end of EVERY checkpoint update:
1. PROJECT_STATE.md
2. CURRENT_FRONTIER.md
3. CHECKPOINTS.md
4. MANAGEMENT_ROADMAP.md

Record BUILT, VERIFIED, CLOSED/BLOCKED/NOT VERIFIED, evidence, blocker, CURRENT FRONTIER, NEXT ACTION, and authorized branch/file scope.

A checkpoint is not governance-complete until the four documents are synchronized and internally consistent.

## BRANCH GOVERNANCE
No branch for personal workflow, experimentation, convenience, speculative work, or parallel truth. Historical branches may be preserved for provenance. Active branches require explicit Management authorization and recorded purpose/source/target/relationship.

## FILE GOVERNANCE
No file outside authorized checkpoint scope becomes Canonical project truth. Temporary, generated, backup, quarantine, forensic, review, and unrelated artifacts require classification before promotion.

## REPOSITORY ORGANIZATION
Repository organization is classification-first and behavior-neutral.
- Governance/control documents remain at repository root.
- Operational source paths are preserved until dependency/path analysis authorizes relocation.
- Verification, evidence/forensic, and historical material have explicit navigation locations.
- `README.md` and `REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md` provide the repository navigation/control layer.

## CURRENT GOVERNANCE GATE
Repository consolidation is CLOSED by Management.
CP44 remains the active frontier.

## CURRENT NEXT ACTION
1. Resolve the real-data continuity blocker for `MHA/USDT` without fabricating, interpolating, filling, padding, or backfilling production context.
2. Do not execute a second CP44 runtime merely to retrieve metrics.
3. After blocker resolution and explicit Management readiness, execute the single next authorized CP44 real-market controlled runtime from the established downstream ELIGIBLE boundary.
4. Preserve all execution, order, API-write, and DB-write prohibitions.
5. Synchronize all four governance documents at CP44 completion before closure.

## CP44 BOOTSTRAP PATCH VERIFICATION — 2026-09-17

The authorized minimal repair to market_arm_contiguous_history_accumulation_v1_1.py has passed Python compilation.

Observed:
- CP44_BOOTSTRAP_PATCH_COMPILE=PASS
- compile exit code 0.

The repair only removes the premature FABRIC_DB_NOT_FOUND gate so the approved local canonical Store can initialize the Fabric DB on first bootstrap.

Preserved:
- dynamic Production Universe;
- Eligibility;
- real KuCoin discovery and OHLCV acquisition;
- CEX + blockchain/DEX Market Information Arm architecture;
- no synthetic/interpolated/fill/backfill/padding/blending behavior;
- production DB isolation;
- protected arunda_pipeline.py;
- execution/order safety boundary.

No second CP44 runtime was executed.

CP44 therefore remains BLOCKED / NOT VERIFIED / NOT CLOSED, with the authoritative runtime blocker:
INSUFFICIENT_CONTIGUOUS_CONTEXT:MHA/USDT:7, MIN_CONTEXT = 21.

## NEXT ACTION
1. Perform static/diff verification of the exact bootstrap patch.
2. Resolve the real-data continuity blocker without fabrication/fill/backfill.
3. Only after explicit Management readiness, execute the next single controlled CP44 runtime.


## CP44 FABRIC SCHEMA BOOTSTRAP — LOCAL COMPILE VERIFICATION — 2026-09-18

VERIFIED:
- `python -m py_compile .\\market_arm_contiguous_history_accumulation_v1_1.py` exited 0.
- `CP44_FABRIC_SCHEMA_BOOTSTRAP_COMPILE=PASS`.

This is implementation/compile evidence only and does not close CP44.

CP44 remains BLOCKED / NOT VERIFIED / NOT CLOSED with authoritative blocker `INSUFFICIENT_CONTIGUOUS_CONTEXT:MHA/USDT:7`, `MIN_CONTEXT=21`.

NEXT ACTION:
1. Complete static/diff verification of the exact authorized patch.
2. Resolve the real contiguous-context blocker without fabrication/fill/backfill.
3. Only after explicit Management readiness, execute the single next controlled CP44 runtime.

## CP44 PROVIDER-CONSISTENCY PATCH — 2026-09-18

AUTHORIZED REPAIR:
Handle the exact direct-KuCoin `Unsupported trading pair` condition as a per-market fail-closed skip inside the dynamic accumulation loop.

RATIONALE:
The Production Universe is dynamically discovered through CCXT, while the direct KuCoin candles endpoint can reject an otherwise discovered market. One provider-inconsistent market must not abort accumulation for every other dynamically discovered market.

CONSTRAINTS PRESERVED:
- dynamic universe remains dynamic;
- no hardcoded BSV removal;
- no provider fallback;
- no synthetic/interpolated/fill/padded/backfilled data;
- no symbol reconstruction from asset;
- no production DB access/write;
- no `arunda_pipeline.py` modification;
- no order/execution/API/exchange writes.

STATUS:
CP44 remains BLOCKED / NOT VERIFIED / NOT CLOSED.

CURRENT BLOCKER:
The latest accumulation attempt aborted at `BSV/USDT:Unsupported trading pair`. The patch addresses that exact failure. The authoritative CP44 runtime blocker remains `INSUFFICIENT_CONTIGUOUS_CONTEXT:MHA/USDT:7`, `MIN_CONTEXT=21`.

NEXT ACTION:
1. Local compile/static verification of the exact patch.
2. Continue real-data accumulation after verification.
3. Resolve `MHA/USDT` contiguous-context blocker without fabrication/fill/backfill.
4. Only after explicit Management readiness, execute the single next CP44 controlled runtime.

## CP44 BOOTSTRAP SCHEMA INITIALIZATION — 2026-09-18

Authorized minimal follow-up repair implemented after static review identified that the approved Store module exposes CREATE_SQL but initializes its schema only inside its fixture verification main().

BUILT:
- market_arm_contiguous_history_accumulation_v1_1.py now performs a Fabric-only schema bootstrap through store.CREATE_SQL before opening the accumulation connection.
- The bootstrap creates the Fabric directory if absent, executes only the approved CREATE_SQL, commits the schema transaction, and closes the bootstrap connection.

VERIFIED:
- Source and approved Store module were inspected on sync/local-project-20260917.
- Store schema contract is CREATE_SQL for canonical_ohlcv.
- The patch does not execute store.main() and does not insert REAL_CANDLE fixture data.
- Production DB remains outside the code path.
- No runtime was executed after this patch.

STATUS:
CP44 = MANAGEMENT-AUTHORIZED / IMPLEMENTATION PATCHED / NOT RUNTIME-VERIFIED / BLOCKED / NOT CLOSED.

BLOCKER:
INSUFFICIENT_CONTIGUOUS_CONTEXT:MHA/USDT:7 with MIN_CONTEXT = 21 remains the authoritative real-market blocker.

NEXT ACTION:
1. Local Python compile/static verification of the patched accumulation file.
2. Resolve the real-data continuity blocker without fabrication, interpolation, fill, padding, or backfill.
3. Only after explicit Management readiness, execute the single next controlled CP44 runtime.

SAFETY:
No arunda.db access/write, no arunda_pipeline.py modification, no order, no execution, no API write, no exchange write, and no second CP44 runtime occurred.

# END MANAGEMENT ROADMAP

## CP44 — CURRENT STATE RECONCILIATION — 2026-09-20

**STATUS:** BLOCKED / NOT VERIFIED / NOT CLOSED

### Latest verified evidence

The previously recorded contiguous-context blocker
INSUFFICIENT_CONTIGUOUS_CONTEXT:MHA/USDT:7 with MIN_CONTEXT = 21
has been resolved through real-data historical discovery and contiguous accumulation.
The historical blocker record remains preserved above as historical evidence and must
not be interpreted as the current CP44 blocker.

Verified controlled accumulation evidence:

- ADX/USDC: RUN=50
- INSERTED=50
- LATEST_CLOSED=1789365600
- CHECKPOINT_COMMITTED=ADX/USDC
- MARKET_ARM_READY=True
- PRODUCTION_DB_TOUCHED=False
- SIGNAL_CHAIN_EXECUTED=False
- ORDER_INTENTS=0
- EXECUTION=OFF
- no order write
- no execution
- no API write
- no exchange write

This establishes that the authorized real-data accumulation path can reach the
required contiguous context without synthetic data, interpolation, fill, padding,
fabrication, backfill, or gap bridging.

### Current CP44 frontier

CP44 is **not closed** by the accumulation result alone. The remaining verification
boundary is the downstream production-compatible controlled chain after established
real-data eligibility, including the authorized Entry / Invalidation-Stop / Smart Risk /
Trade Gate / Trade Ready contract path.

No premature CP44 closure is permitted.

### Current next action

1. Preserve the successful accumulation evidence above.
2. Complete the remaining static/contract reconciliation required for the downstream
   CP44 controlled path.
3. Only after explicit Management readiness, execute the single next authorized
   CP44 real-market controlled runtime from the established downstream ELIGIBLE
   boundary.
4. Do not modify runda.db or runda_pipeline.py.
5. Do not introduce synthetic/fill/interpolation/padding/backfill data.
6. Do not execute orders or enable execution.

The previous MHA/USDT:7 blocker and the earlier no-second-runtime restriction remain
historical records; they do not override this newer verified accumulation evidence.

## CP44 — SMART RISK COMPATIBILITY REPAIR — 2026-09-20

### VERIFIED

The authorized CP44 minimal Smart Risk compatibility repair has completed
technical verification.

VERIFIED EVIDENCE:
- CP38-D direct Smart Risk compatibility = PASS.
- CP38-H SmartRiskDecision constructor compatibility = PASS.
- CP44 explicit LONG Entry + Invalidation = PASS.
- CP44 explicit SHORT Entry + Invalidation = PASS.
- Invalid LONG/SHORT invalidation geometry = BLOCKED / FAIL-CLOSED.
- Dynamic Smart Risk LONG = PASS.
- Dynamic Smart Risk SHORT = PASS.
- Missing explicit invalidation at the Dynamic Boundary = BLOCKED / FAIL-CLOSED.
- Dynamic Smart Risk snapshot asset identity N-to-N = PASS.
- Frozen risk-budget semantics preserved:
  Base Risk = Portfolio Capital × Risk Per Trade.
  Remaining Portfolio Risk = Max Portfolio Risk − Already Allocated Risk.
  Risk Budget = min(Base Risk × Risk Adjustments, Remaining Portfolio Risk).
  Position Size = Risk Budget / Stop Distance.
  Exposure = Position Size × Entry Price.
- No allocation_fraction / allocated_capital sizing semantics restored.
- Dynamic Boundary retains ACTIONABLE decision prerequisite.
- SmartRiskDecision remains constructor-compatible with optional invalidation_price.

SCOPE:
Only the two Management-authorized files were modified:
- smart_risk_contract_v0_1.py
- smart_risk_engine_v0_1.py

PROTECTED:
- arunda.db = UNTOUCHED
- arunda_pipeline.py = UNTOUCHED
- market_arm_contiguous_history_accumulation_v1_1.py = UNTOUCHED
- public_market_data_fabric/canonical_store_v0.1.sqlite = UNTOUCHED

SAFETY:
- Production runtime = NOT EXECUTED
- Fabric runtime = NOT EXECUTED
- Execution = OFF
- Order intents = 0
- API/exchange writes = 0

### STATUS

CP44 SMART RISK COMPATIBILITY REPAIR = VERIFIED.

CP44 = NOT CLOSED.

CP45 = NOT STARTED.

### CURRENT FRONTIER

The Smart Risk compatibility boundary is technically verified.
The remaining CP44 work is the downstream production-compatible controlled
verification boundary: established real-data eligibility → Entry /
Invalidation-Stop → Smart Risk → Trade Gate → Trade Ready.

No premature CP44 closure is permitted.

### NEXT ACTION

Only after explicit Management readiness, proceed to the single authorized
CP44 real-market controlled verification of the established downstream path.

No production DB modification.
No arunda_pipeline.py modification.
No synthetic/fill/interpolation/padding/backfill.
No order creation.
Execution remains OFF.

# END CP44 SMART RISK COMPATIBILITY REPAIR


## CP44 — HISTORICAL BUY RULE RECOVERY CLOSURE — 2026-09-20

### GOVERNANCE RESULT
BUY RULE RECOVERY:
`STATUS = COMPLETE`
`RESULT = PARTIAL / NOT RECOVERED`
`AUTHORITATIVE_MARKET_BUY_TRIGGER = NOT RECOVERED`

Historical lineage recovered:
`Signal → Validation → Fusion → Score → Decision → downstream`

Historical source:
- `arunda_pipeline.py`
- commit `7eef0fb7868e84c9b85570d9a7bfab5ce9f8f314`

Historical `ACTIONABLE_DECISIONS = {"BUY", "LONG", "SHORT", "ACTIONABLE"}` is classification/acceptance of an already-produced decision and is not a Market BUY Trigger.

### NOT RECOVERED
No authoritative independent rule of the form:
`SIGNAL CONDITIONS + SCORE THRESHOLD + CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD → BUY`
or an equivalent historical Market BUY Trigger was recovered.

No threshold/formula/condition was invented.

### CAPITAL GOVERNANCE
Capital remains variable. Historical `CAPITAL = 1,000,000` and historical risk constants remain historical/test/review artifacts and are not restored as Production Policy.

### CP44 STATE
BUY Rule Recovery is complete as an investigation result.
CP44 remains:
`ACTIVE / BLOCKED / NOT VERIFIED / NOT CLOSED`

The current frontier remains:
`ELIGIBLE[N] → ENTRY/INVALIDATION → SMART RISK → OPPORTUNITY-DRIVEN CAPITAL ALLOCATION / ALLOCATED-RISK PROVENANCE → POSITION SIZING → TRADE GATE → TRADE READY`.

No upstream Opportunity/Signal/Fusion/Score/Decision reconstruction is authorized for this closure.

Known independent Toobit private-account blocker:
`HTTP 400 / -1022 INVALID_SIGNATURE`.
It remains outside the provider-neutral CP44 core frontier and must not be bypassed or repeated without explicit authorization.

### HANDOFF
NEXT BUILDER MUST NOT RE-RUN HISTORICAL BUY-RULE RECOVERY.
Historical BUY Rule Recovery is COMPLETE.
Authoritative Market BUY Trigger was NOT recovered.
Do not invent BUY threshold, score threshold, confidence threshold, signal formula, or entry trigger.
Do not reopen Smart Risk, Decision, Entry/Stop, Trade Gate, Trade Intent, or CP43.
Continue only from the remaining ACTIVE CP44 blockers documented in PROJECT_STATE / CURRENT_FRONTIER / CHECKPOINTS.
CP45 MUST NOT START.



## CP44 — PIPELINE SMART RISK WIRING CHAPTER — 2026-09-21

### MANAGEMENT DECISION
The CP44 Pipeline risk wiring was authorized for a minimal provider-neutral repair with Runtime explicitly protected.

### IMPLEMENTATION
- Added `cp44_smart_risk_pipeline_boundary_v0_1.py`.
- Rewired `arunda_pipeline.py` from legacy Dynamic Risk to Dynamic Smart Risk.
- Entry/Invalidation remains an explicit upstream contract; no inference is permitted.
- Capital remains dynamic and must come from an explicit real observation.
- Smart Risk policy must be explicitly validated.
- Missing capital/policy/Entry/Invalidation fails closed.
- Toobit remains outside Core and is not introduced into the Smart Risk path.

### COMMITS
- `b9394237085be15ed10d98c477befd387c4491d4` — boundary module
- `fda84acd03edb0837cabd3a2ca1c447b217031d4` — Pipeline wiring

### GATE STATE
**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE FOR THIS CHAPTER / STATIC VERIFICATION PENDING / RUNTIME = 0**

### REQUIRED NEXT STEP
Builder performs local compile + static/diff verification only. If green, Management reviews readiness. Only then may the single authorized CP44 controlled Runtime proceed.

### CONTINUATION RULE
The next Builder must not assume that implementation verification equals Runtime readiness. The new wiring is deliberately fail-closed until real dynamic capital, explicit Entry/Invalidation, and validated policy are proven on the actual production-compatible path.

### FORBIDDEN
No fixed capital. No test fixture capital. No Runtime retry. No second Runtime. No DB write. No order. No API/exchange write. No Toobit dependency in Core. No closed-stage re-audit.

# END CP44 PIPELINE SMART RISK WIRING CHAPTER


## CP44 — NEUTRAL-SIGNAL BOUNDARY REPAIR — 2026-09-22

STATUS:
**IMPLEMENTATION PATCHED / VERIFICATION PENDING / BLOCKED / NOT CLOSED**

ROOT CAUSE:
The single authorized CP44 runtime reached 420 validated signals and failed at the CP44 Live Predictive Evidence Mapping boundary because Dynamic Signal/Validation legitimately permit `NONE` for neutral state while the mapping accepted only `LONG/SHORT`.

PATCH:
- `NONE` → explicit `NoPredictiveEvidence(status=NO_PREDICTIVE_EVIDENCE)`
- `LONG/SHORT` → existing directional mapping
- invalid direction → `INVALID_DIRECTION` fail-closed
- no BUY/SELL inference
- outcome/future-information guards preserved
- asset and provenance preserved

FILES:
- `cp44_live_predictive_evidence_mapping_v0_1.py`
- `test_cp44_live_predictive_evidence_mapping_v0_1.py`

CARDINALITY:
Direct test coverage includes 420 observations with explicit directional vs no-evidence classification and asset identity preservation.

VERIFICATION:
GitHub-side structural inspection confirms the intended two-file delta only. Local Python compile and direct test execution have not yet been performed in this management turn; no PASS is claimed.

SAFETY:
Runtime for this repair = 0. Total CP44 runtime count remains 1. No second runtime, DB write, exchange/API write, order, or execution.

NEXT ACTION:
Targeted local compile + direct boundary tests only. Then Management readiness review. CP45 remains forbidden.

## CP44 — MANAGEMENT READINESS REVIEW — 2026-09-22

### REVIEW STATUS
**READINESS REVIEW = PASS FOR THE NEXT CONTROLLED VERIFICATION GATE**

The authorized Neutral-Signal Boundary Repair is now locally verified:
- targeted `py_compile` = PASS;
- direct boundary tests = 7/7 PASS;
- `LONG` = directional Predictive Evidence;
- `SHORT` = directional Predictive Evidence;
- `NONE/NEUTRAL` = explicit `NO_PREDICTIVE_EVIDENCE`;
- invalid direction = fail-closed;
- cardinality, asset identity, provenance, and leakage guards = PASS.

### SAFETY GATE
- Repair runtime = 0.
- Total CP44 real-market runtime count = 1.
- Second CP44 runtime is **NOT EXECUTED by this review**.
- Execution = OFF.
- Production DB = UNTOUCHED.
- DB writes = 0.
- Exchange/API writes = 0.
- Order intents = 0.
- `arunda_pipeline.py` = unchanged.
- No synthetic/fill/interpolation/padding/backfill introduced.

### MANAGEMENT DETERMINATION
The previously verified Neutral-Signal boundary blocker is cleared.

The repository is **READY FOR THE NEXT EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED CP44 CONTROLLED RUNTIME GATE**, but this readiness review does **not** itself execute that runtime.

CP44 remains **NOT CLOSED** until the downstream real-market controlled verification is actually proven.

CP45 = **NOT STARTED / FORBIDDEN**.

### NEXT ACTION
Only upon explicit runtime authorization, execute the single next CP44 real-market controlled verification from the established downstream ELIGIBLE boundary. Preserve all existing safety constraints: execution OFF, no order, no exchange write, no production DB write.
